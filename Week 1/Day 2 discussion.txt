Different kinds of Analysis you can do with data
1. Descriptive Analysis
	Statistical Analysis - Mean, Median, Mode, Std. Deviation, Variance
	Mean should be avoided in case of Outliers (we use Median in this case)
2. Exploratory Analysis - Finding patterns between different datasets or variables
3. Inferential Analysis - 
4. Predictive Analysis - On basis of Independent variables we determine behaviour of Dependent variables
5. Causal Analysis
